    "abstract": "<p>\nWe study the problem of learning two regimes (we have a normal and a\nprefault regime in mind) based on a train set of non-Markovian\nobservation sequences. Key to the  \nmodel is that we assume that once the system switches from the normal\nto the prefault regime it cannot restore and will eventually result in \na fault. We refer to the particular setting as\n<i>semi-supervised</i> since we assume the only information given\nto the learner is whether a particular sequence ended with a stop\n(implying that the sequence was generated by the normal regime) or\nwith a fault (implying that there was a switch from the normal to the\nfault regime). In the latter case the particular time point at which a\nswitch occurred is not known. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe underlying model used is a <i>switching linear \ndynamical system (SLDS)</i>. The constraints in the regime transition\nprobabilities result in an exact inference procedure that scales\nquadratically with the length of a sequence. \nMaximum aposteriori (MAP) parameter estimates can be\nfound using an expectation maximization (EM) \nalgorithm with this inference algorithm in the E-step.\nFor long sequences this will not be practically feasible and an\napproximate inference and an approximate EM procedure is called\nfor. We describe a flexible class of approximations corresponding to\ndifferent choices of clusters in a Kikuchi free energy with weak\nconsistency constraints.\n</p>",
