    "abstract": "In supervised machine learning, the partitioning of the values (also called grouping) of a categorical attribute aims at constructing a new synthetic attribute which keeps the information of the initial attribute and reduces the number of its values. In this paper, we propose a new grouping method MODL founded on a Bayesian approach. The method relies on a model space of grouping models and on a prior distribution defined on this model space. This results in an evaluation criterion of grouping, which is minimal for the most probable grouping given the data, <i>i.e.</i> the Bayes optimal grouping. We propose new super-linear optimization heuristics that yields near-optimal groupings. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that the MODL grouping method builds high quality groupings in terms of predictive quality, robustness and small number of groups.",
