    "abstract": "A mechnism of transfer learning is analysed, where samples drawn from\ndifferent learning tasks of an environment are used to improve the learners\nperformance on a new task. We give a general method to prove generalisation\nerror bounds for such meta-algorithms. The method can be applied to the bias\nlearning model of J. Baxter and to derive novel generalisation bounds for\nmeta-algorithms searching spaces of uniformly stable algorithms. We also\npresent an application to regularized least squares regression.",
